# offline first workshop

Welcome to the offline workshop codebase. Here we will be moving through the various branches to see how things work and to build on the code to make really cool things happen. So hang on and get ready to rock and roll.

## Step 1
You have made it to step 1. 

### So what do we have in Step 1?
We have a functioning node app... or we should.
`npm start` is your friend. Run it and you should be up and running on `http://localhost:1337`.

## Step 2
You have made it to step 2. Well done grasshopper.

### So what do we have in Step 2?
A basic tic-tac-toe game. Using some discrete mathmatics to calculate who wins and who loses.

Also events for loos coupling and general awesomeness.
