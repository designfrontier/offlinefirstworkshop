# offline first workshop

Welcome to the offline workshop codebase. Here we will be moving through the various branches to see how things work and to build on the code to make really cool things happen. So hang on and get ready to rock and roll.

## Steps
There are 5 steps in this repo. Branches step1-step5 contain a variety of incremental changes to the code to get us closer to an offline web application. Check them out and see what changes...

Once you arrive at step 5 you should try and extend what is done with something of your own. That way you can play with the tools and get to feel comfortable with them.

Good luck grasshopper.
